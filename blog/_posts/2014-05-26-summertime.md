title: Summertime Begins Now
---
So, I figure here might be a good place to collect thoughts, at least to start. I'm not one for doing a lot of blog writing, as I've tried often in the past to start blogs and they have, without fail, died off. Usually it's becasue I get distracted by the next big thing, or perhaps by the work I have to do, but this time I am trying to stick to it. There's a lot of things lately that I've not been doing a good job of sticking to... So perhaps by practicing on blogging, I can move onto bigger things! And summer is a great time to do that, the freedom and exploration it affords is intoxicating and uplifting.

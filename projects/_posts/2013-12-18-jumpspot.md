#Positioning

Jumpspot is an event app that focuses on the creation, planning and organization of events around Olin. Unlike Facebook, Twitter, or the current Olin mailing lists, Jumpspot events are not restricted to people users know; it allows for a wider audience, while still allowing users to create and be part of groups which the events are targeted towards. Jumpspot makes use of both google maps and a list format to provide a quick and clear view of the event’s time and location. 

#Elevator Pitch

Do you often find yourself wishing for an organized view of all the events going on at Olin? Do you find yourself wishing for a way keep track of when and where each event is taking place? Do you find yourself missing events at Olin? We’re developing a web app which will help you create, plan and organize events for you.

#Features
<ul>
  <li><b>Filter Feature:</b>   events are tagged and filterable based on user's interests</li>
  <li><b>List View:</b>   list of upcoming events, with tags, "eta" and location</li>
  <li><b>Map View:</b>   integration with google maps API, events are automatically added to map</li>
  <li><b>Event Profiles:</b>  time, place, and description</li>
  <li><b>Integration:</b>   supports Facebook events and groups, Twitter</li>
</ul>

#Consumer Research
We created three different surveys: one for Olin Carpe users, Olin Non-Carpe users and one for students outside of Olin. For Olin Carpe users, our survey had questions about how they use Carpe, habits and personality. For Olin Non-Carpe users, our survey had questions about their habits, personality and their attitude towards Facebook event features. For students outside of Olin, our survey was similar to Olin Non-Carpe users but also had questions about modes of technologies on their campus to share events with friends and they would use an app like JumpSpot. The results are below.

#Technical Feasibility
Our app is comprised of several different components. Whether it is a mobile app or online web app, it is extremely technically feasible:

##<i>Organization / College Affiliation Authentication:</i>
Authentication is a crucial feature for JumpSpot. It’s imperative that all of JumpSpot’s users feel safe about the events available through the app. Therefore, JumpSpot will have its own user authentication system. Only users from specific colleges or organizations (at first, Olin) will be able to create an account and use the app.
Users will create an account with their college / organization-affiliated email. Like all online sites and services, they will have to confirm their email address through an email. Then, the system will check to ensure that the email belongs to the college / organization they are supposed to be affiliated with (ex: it is an olin.edu address for Olin).

##<i>App Event List Feature:</i>
We are using a database system to store each of the events, storing with each event important information, such as the name, an ID number, time, place, participants restrictions, max size possible, critical value, and anything else that we find we require to specify everything about an event. When a user then looks for events, the database is queried using SQL and all the events that matches the search are pulled up and made available for viewing. 

##<i>App Map Feature:</i>
For the web page version of JumpSpot, we are going to integrate with the Google maps API. The API is easy to integrate with any website setup and can easily plot as many locations that we want, when given only the address. For our iPhone version of the app, Apple has integrated with Google maps to provide a built in API that is very useable for showing a map within the app.

##<i>Integration with Facebook:</i>
We are developing our website and app with Facebook integration and login. People will be able to authenticate and log in with Facebook and then share and invite friends through Facebook. Luckily, Facebook makes this exceptionally easy and has an easy to use API for integration. We have previous experience with integrating Facebook in apps, and it is exceptionally easy. 

##<i>Server hosting and setup:</i>
Back end server structure should be relatively simple and scalable. What we primary need is to have a series of databases tracking users and events, and then a PHP/Ruby front-end to deliver that content. Amazon AWS should be able to provide much of what we need and at a fraction of the cost if we even need that scale, but even a simple VPS or dedicated server should be fine at lower traffic volumes. The main threats come from the CDN we might need (if we look at hosting images ourselves) and from being overwhelmed (not likely at our scale, we should also be able to accommodate if there is advanced warning in most cases.) Servers would just be set up as basic linux boxes with whatever server software needed installed.

#Financial Feasibility
We are estimating that we need twenty-five thousand dollars to run a company with a runway of 2 years. Our financial model includes $100 a month for servers, $900 for a month for marketing costs and minimum living expenses during two summers. We estimate that we achieve 18% user growth each month by rolling out to colleges within two years to become active users of JumpSpot. First, we’ll introduce JumpSpot to Olin, Wellesley College and Babson College. Then, we’ll roll out to schools in the Boston area like Boston University, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. We believe that we can achieve at least ten thousand users in two years.

For now, our goal is to create a large user base. Once we have achieved our goal, we intend to monetize from in-app advertisements targeting towards college students and sponsored events from local businesses. We estimate that we will earn $10 CPM.
